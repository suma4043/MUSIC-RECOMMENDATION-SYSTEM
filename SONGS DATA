The SONGS Folder consistes of the files in csv format which are the ones I used for my recommendation code it contains the lyrics of songs written by different authors .
I used the similarity between these lyrics and generated the recommended songs . I also used Natural Language Tool Kit for preprocessing of the lyrics and it is content
based recommendation system which reccommends the songs directly based on individuals Liking and Disliking of the songs , where the sraight forword Procedure for it is 
vectoriztion and calculating the cosine similrity.
